    <div class="tile image-1"></div>
    <div class="tile image-2"></div>
    <div class="tile image-3"></div>
    <div class="tile image-4"></div>

    <p>These images will be resized to the size of the tiles by me, once that size is decided upon. This will
      improve the quality of the images and will allow me to put them in the background of the tiles without having
      to repeat the background vertically (that's why it looks like a slot machine right now). Let me know if this is 
      something you're interested in. We can also make any design tweaks you'd like.
