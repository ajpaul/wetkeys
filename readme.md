  ## wetkeys  
  
  David,
  
  Download this folder anywhere onto your computer (you need to download the entire folder!). Go into the folder and open wetkeys.html and you will see the tile examples. If you are having trouble seeing them, make sure you have a folder called CSS in with wetkeys.html.
  
  Please suggest any tweaks to the design if you'd like. I recall you mentioning that you wanted some image tiles like this. They are responsive, but do not resize (they just will wrap and stack when the screen is reduced). This will need to be fine-tuned though because it's just a quick demo.
